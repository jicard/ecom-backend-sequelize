## Description
This project simulates a basic Ecommerce api, along with the ability to add database connectivity and manipulate data through the use of Sequelize. 
## Installation
To run this project, you can clone this repository, download the necessary packages, and run the corresponding mysql and node.js commands. 
## Usage
Anyone developing an Ecommerce platform could use this project as a basic outline for their back-end, as this project puts together an API setup with routes for categories, products, and tags. It also sets up a database that we are able to manipulate through mysql2 and Sequelize.

## Testing
The main goal of this project is to show how API routes and an integrated database can interact. To test the functionality of this project, you can use the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods to ensure a user could communicate with the API and the database can be manipulated accordingly.
